# ALU_IndiGen
An Indian population specific polymorphic Alu insertion map 

Here, we report the genomic landscape of Alu InDels from the recently released 1,021 Indian Genomes (IndiGen) (Available at https://clingen.igib.res.in/indigen). We identified 9,239 polymorphic Alu insertions that include private (3,831), rare (3,974), and common (1,434) insertions with an average of 770 insertions per individual. We achieved an 89% PCR validation of the predicted genotypes in 94 samples tested. About 60% of identified indels are unique to IndiGen when compared to other global datasets; 23% of sites were shared with both SGDP and HGSVC; amongst these, 58% (1,289 sites) were common polymorphisms in IndiGen.
